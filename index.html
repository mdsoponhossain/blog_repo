            <p class="text-xl font-semibold"><span class="text-3xl">Ans:</span> var is not a block scope variable like let and const .If the var is
                declared in a block scope element,then the var is hoisted that means you can access that var form
                outside the block scope element.But you can redeclare and reset the var.let is a block scope variable
                .It means you can't access the let outside of that block element and you can reset the value of let but
                not redeclare.
                const is a block scope variable .You can not access outside of a block scope element.you can't reset and
                redeclare the const . </p>

                .</h1>
            <p class="text-xl font-semibold"><span class="text-3xl">Ans:</span>null means the variable has been declared but it's value is empty.If you set the value of  any variable like empty,it will the null.If you check the typeof null, it will be the object.And undefined means the variable is declared or assign but the value is not assign or set .If you check the typeof undefined, it will be undefined.Sothat , the typeof undefined is undefined and the typeof null is an object.  </p>
